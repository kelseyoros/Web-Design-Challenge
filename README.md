# Web-Design-Challenge

This challenge uses data and visualizations from the python-api-challenge.  I took the analysis from the previously mentioned challenge and displayed it on a web page.  This web page was ultimately deployed to GitHub Pages.  Check out the final product [here](https://kelseyoros.github.io/Web-Design-Challenge/)!

The website consists of 7 pages total, including:
* A navigation menu that:
	* Has the name of the site on the left of the nav which allows users to return to the landing page from any page.
	* Contains a dropdown on the right of the navbar named "Plots" which provides links to each individual visualization page.
	* Provides two more links on the right: "Comparisons" which links to the comparisons page, and "Data" which links to the data page.
	* Is responsive
* A landing page containing:
  * An explanation of the project.
  * Links to each visualizations page.
* Four visualization pages, each with:
  * A descriptive title and heading tag.
  * The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
  * A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.
* A "Comparisons" page that:
  * Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
  * Uses a bootstrap grid for the visualizations.
* A "Data" page that:
  * Uses bootstrap to display a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
